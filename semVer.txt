Semantic Versioning

"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"

The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. 

The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.

The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. 


To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, 
you can prefix the dependency's version with the tilde (~) character.
"package": "~1.2.8"
This would allow updates to any 1.2.x version of the package.


the caret (^) allows npm to install future updates as well. 
The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.
"package": "^1.3.8"
This would allow updates to any 1.x.x version of the package.
